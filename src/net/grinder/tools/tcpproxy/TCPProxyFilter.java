/**
 * Interface that TCP Proxy filters must implement.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, filters are registered with a PicoContainer. They can learn
 * about a {@link net.grinder.common.Logger}, other filters, and custom
 * components (see the TCPProxy <code>-component</code> option) through
 * constructor injection. Filters can also implement the PicoContainer life
 * cycle methods {@link org.picocontainer.Startable} and
 * {@link org.picocontainer.Disposable}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Well behaved filters should not swallow {@link InterruptedException}s.
 * Ideally, they should convert {@link InterruptedException}s to
 * {@link net.grinder.common.UncheckedInterruptedException}s; but alternatively
 * they could reinstate the Thread's interrupted status.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link ConnectionDetails#equals equality semantics} of the
 * <code>ConnectionDetails</code> passed to each method can be used to
 * uniquely identify a connection.
