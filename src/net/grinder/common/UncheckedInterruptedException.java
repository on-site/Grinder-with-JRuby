/**
 * Make {@link InterruptedException}s and {@link InterruptedIOException}s
 * easier to propagate.
 *
 * <p>
 * Our policy on interrupt handling:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Thread#interrupt()} and {@link ThreadGroup#interrupt()} are used
 * in shut down code. We can't simply swallow {@link InterruptedException}s.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Whenever core code catches an {@link InterruptedException} which it
 * doesn't know how to handle, it rethrows it in an
 * {@link UncheckedInterruptedException}.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link net.grinder.util.thread.InterruptibleRunnable#interruptibleRun()}
 * implementations are carefully reviewed to ensure that they do not ignore the
 * interrupt condition and will exit whenever {@link InterruptedException} and
 * {@link InterruptedIOException}s are received. We only interrupt code that
 * implements
 * {@link net.grinder.util.thread.InterruptibleRunnable#interruptibleRun()}.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>The InterruptibleRunnable's are invoked by wrapping then in an
 * InterruptibleRunnableAdapter. This exits cleanly, silently handling
 * {@link UncheckedInterruptedException}s.</li>
 *
 * <li>Whenever core code outside an
 * {@link net.grinder.util.thread.InterruptibleRunnable} catches an
 * {@link IOException}, it calls {@link #ioException(IOException)}, which will
 * throw an {@link UncheckedInterruptedException} if necessary.</li>
 *
 * <li>Other code may exit cleanly or may ignore the interrupt condition due to
 * third-party libraries swallowing {@link InterruptedException}s. This doesn't
 * matter as we should never interrupt this code.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
