/**
 * Indicates that an HTTP request timed out.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Grinder throws this exception, rather than simply marking a test failure
 * and continuing, since the rest of the test script might be invalid if the
 * request didn't complete successfully. If you want to ignore whether a
 * particular request timed out or not, you can write something like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * from net.grinder.plugin.http import TimeoutException
 * # ...
 * try: myrequest.GET(&quot;http://myurl.com&quot;)
 * except TimeoutException: pass
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you'd also like to mark the current test as "bad", do this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * grinder.statistics.delayReports = 1
 * # ...
 * try: myrequest.GET(&quot;http://myurl.com&quot;)
 * except TimeoutException: grinder.statistics.forLastTest.success = 0
 * </pre>
