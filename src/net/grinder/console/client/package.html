Client API for The Grinder console.

<p>The current implementation builds up the standard grinder communications
package, which can run over streams including process input/output streams and
a custom TCP/IP socket protocol layer. The communication package uses Java
Serialization for marshalling. To implement the client API, the communications
package was extended to support a "blocking send" over TCP/IP. (Previously,
only "one-way", asynchronous messaging had been required).</p>

<p>I decided that the console API required synchronous interaction since
this provides a more natural API. In the future, I may extend it to include
an asynchronus event channel for pushing data back to "subscribing" clients.
</p>

<p>Some notes about the alternatives I rejected:

<ul>
  <li>Hessian not usable - requires a servlet engine.</li>

  <li>Java RMI - possible.
     <ul>
       <li>Build process would need to invoke <code> rmic</code>.</li>
       <li>Bootstrapping issues are painful. Wouldn't want to run separate
       registry process. Really don't want to have new ports to contact
       the console - configuration more complext, would prevent simple
       tunnelling. Extending the grinder comms layer to provide bootstrapping
       is at least as work than implementing synchronous messaging ourselves.

     </ul>
