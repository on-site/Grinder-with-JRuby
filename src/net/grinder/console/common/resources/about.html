<br><br>The Grinder is a pure Java load-testing framework that is
freely available under a BSD style open-source license. It was
originally developed for the book <em>Professional Java 2 Enterprise
Edition with BEA WebLogic Server</em> by Paco G&oacute;mez and Peter
Zadrozny.

<br><br>Philip Aston took ownership of the code and reworked it to
create <strong>The&nbsp;Grinder&nbsp;2</strong>. Philip continues to
enhance and maintain The Grinder.

<br><br>More recently The Grinder 2 has featured in the book <em>J2EE
Performance Testing with BEA WebLogic Server</em> by Peter Zadrozny,
Philip Aston and Ted Osborne.

<br><br>The Grinder 3 introduces a Jython scripting engine enabling
powerful, expressive test scripts to be executed.

<br><br>The Grinder's home page is <a
