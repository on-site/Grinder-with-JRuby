This is The Grinder TODO list. Its a collection of my thoughts on the
future of The Grinder.

If you want to implement something off this wish list, let me know
first by discussion your ideas on the grinder-development list. There
are instructions on how to contribute at
http://grinder.sourceforge.net/development/contributing.html.

The TODO list is part of the binary distribution. I'll accept patches
against it too :-).

* Other languages

Implement a javax.script wrapper that is loaded if detected.
Prove by implementing support for JavaScript (which is built into Java 6).


* Java 5 upgrade

** Checkstyle vs "<"

** Opportunities
*** JUC executors, CAS etc.

*** System.nanoTime() - can move to microsecond based time?



* Enhancements

** Console API

*** API

- Move Identity and Report interfaces to a separate, common package
- Add way to query the latest process reports through the console API


Process control

 void startWorkerProcess(some id)
 void stopWorkerProcess(some id)
 List<ProcessStatus> getProcessStatus() - NB return value
 void addProcessEventListener(ProcessEventListener)

 void setScript(...?)

Recording control (done).

 void startRecording()
 void stopRecording()
 void resetRecording()


*** what about access from grinder scripts?

*** sample log file

*** feedback from travis
Comments on the API: -

 * For sure there will need to be an ability to retrieve stats, as you
mentioned.

 * A file transfer API, or some other configuration management API will
be needed so that a centrally managed config, such as might be included
in grinder.properties, can be pushed out to the agents.

 * Right now I'm using scripted ssh calls to start the agents on the
remote machines.  It would be better if there was a good, generic,
cross-platform way the controller/console could initiate a connection to
a given agent.  This might mean having the agent process running as a
server/service on the agent machine, so that it would always be
available.

** Script Distribution

Task: Distribution file filter should be dynamically settable.

** Console

*** Stop the recording when last thread terminates
Requested by Jýrgen Weber

*** Refactoring

Consider moving overwrite / save before close / ... handling to the
model. Needs some kind of command pattern to represent choices.

*** Add log panel

Report log messages that currently go to terminal, plus start, stop
test runs etc. Logs should be time stamped. Use log to replace use of
System.err for warnings.

*** Future editor features

Revert file.
Status bar.
Undo.
Copy and Paste menu items.

Specialised grinder properties editor.

**** jEdit

Replace jEdit-syntax with new jEdit syntax package when available, if
its license terms are acceptable. Apparently now available.

    Clause 2b:

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.


    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
    the sharing and reuse of software generally.

** Engine

There should be an ExternalFilenameFactory, cf ExternalLogger.


Support for some sort of "Surrogate task" that is run in a pool of threads and
has its own statistics context would be good.


*** Instrumentation API

Could we support a procedural "startTest()", "stopTest()" API?

Perhaps. This procedural style would certainly be more obvious
to the average user than "wrapping". OTOH, wrapping is powerful
and I'm not sure we want to support two mechanisms to instrument
code.

** Communication

Resolve anomaly that Senders throw exceptions but Receivers return null.

** Statistics

Should TPS averages be harmonic means?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean

Split out serializeable kernel of TestStatisticsMap? Look hard at where the
message is deserialised.

*** Aligning data files

Requested by Jose Antonio Zapata:

Add an additional "milliseconds since the Epoch" entry to the data
files.

*** Separate out console statistics views from summary statistics views

Needed for custom statistics that use 'period' so are valid in the
console but not in the process logs.

*** max(), min()

(Requested by Venelin Mitov).

Should store max, min values against SampleStatistics, and add max(),
min() to expressions.


** TCPProxy

Change TCPProxy filters to a stream oriented model. This should cure
another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large
outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per
connection.

Internationalise messages.

Support different client certificates for proxied connection.

Allow the filters to optionally parse unknown command line options.
They would also then have to be able to contribute to the help text.
This would allow the http plugin to add options to specify a
different filename, and also to specify stdout.

Failed connection events.

** HTTP Plugin

Remove ParseException, ProtocolNotSuppException from public APIs.

Script support for HTTP "system property" options.

Pablo Estades Fernýndez says:
 > I need to use client cert on TCPProxy to be able to

 > grinder workers to run the test case presenting a

** Scripting

Consider forcing TestRunner to be registered with grinder.

Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
to be recorded.

Script access to global statistics.

*** Events
Idea from Nurul Choudhury:

To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many.

** Reports

Perhaps JasperReports?

** Code

Review use of Executor. Probably want to share them.

Remove ThreadLocal from RegisteredPlugin.


** Other HTTP/HTML libraries

OK, this amounts to a campaign against HTTPClient!


Reasons for HTTPClient:
  - Its solid, (and not 'alpha' which is the case for
    HttpClient).
  - Its small and comprehensible.
  - It is efficient.
  - Its extremely well written.
  - Its the incumbent.

Reasons for Commons HttpClient:
  - Its actively maintained.
  - It is more modular.
  - It is richer.

Reasons for HttpUnit:
  - nekohtml, parsing support

I prefer HttpClient, HTTPClient over HttpUnit for The Grinder as they
are "closer to the wire".

*** Summary
On balance, yes HttpClient looks good and we should use it if it
proves to be efficient. I'll add it to the TODO, but its a significant
change => low priority.

Update (Oct 05): Doubts about HttpClient's scalability:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8372852&forum_id=2649

We perhaps need to look more closely at parsing support for
functional assertions, but I don't want to lose The Grinder's
efficiency here.

* Bugs

(In addition to those on Sourceforge).

** Console/agent
Each time L&F changes, the saveAs dialog gets another All Files
filter!

Add reset console action.

** TCPProxy
Should listen on all interfaces if -localhost is not specified.

* Build

How to build clover reports during full build?
 - currently "with.clover" only works if clover is first thing on
 path, we need to do two "compile", "test" runs with different
 classes.dir.
 - could have with ant-call, modify compile, compile-tests, test
 - better to ant ourself?

Include Clover history?

* Documentation

** Examples

HTTPS.

Basic authentication.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.grinder.user/186

** Forrest TODO

Create back links from javadoc. This isn't trivial, e.g. this:

      <bottom>
  <![CDATA[
  <a class="noborder" href="../whats-new.html"
  target="_top"><img src="../../images/grinder3.jpg"></img></a>
  ]]>
      </bottom>

only works for top level javadoc.

Create menu links to the javadoc.

How to include arbitrary HTML (e.g. for poll forms?)
