   * On JRockit 1.4.2_10 and a Dell 520, I've seen this code:
   *
   *   final long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
   *   Thread.sleep(50);
   *   System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis()-t1);
   *
   * print out "47". I've repeated this with Thread.sleep(50, 0).
   * Javadoc for System.currentTimeMillis() mentions its inaccuracy, and I think
   * it's this method rather than Thread.sleep() that's so slack. Can't use
   * System.nanoTime() as we can't assume J2SE 1.5.
   *
   * Value obtained empirically.
